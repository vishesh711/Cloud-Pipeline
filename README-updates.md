# Error Fixes for AWS Amplify Imports

## Issues Fixed

The frontend code was encountering several import errors related to AWS Amplify. The following issues have been addressed:

1. Missing AWS Amplify module exports:
   - `Auth`, `API`, and `Hub` were not found in 'aws-amplify'
   - The aws-exports.js file was missing

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated Import Statements

AWS Amplify v6+ uses a modular structure where each service has its own import path. We've updated all import statements from:

```javascript
import { Amplify, Auth, API, Hub } from 'aws-amplify';
```

To the correct modular imports:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import { Auth } from '@aws-amplify/auth';
import { API } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import { Hub } from '@aws-amplify/core';
```

### 2. Created AWS Exports Configuration

Created a placeholder `aws-exports.js` file that contains the necessary configuration structure. This file needs to be updated with your actual AWS resource IDs after the backend deployment.

### 3. Updated Package Dependencies

Updated package.json to:
- Add the required AWS Amplify modules (@aws-amplify/auth, @aws-amplify/api, etc.)
- Update React and React Router versions to compatible versions

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the backend using AWS CDK as described in the main README
2. Update the placeholder values in `aws-exports.js` with the actual values from your CDK deployment:
   - User Pool ID
   - User Pool Web Client ID
   - API endpoint URL

## Additional Notes

- The placeholder `aws-exports.js` configuration uses dummy values and will not connect to real AWS services until updated
- If you encounter CORS issues after connecting to real AWS services, check your API Gateway configuration in the CDK stack
